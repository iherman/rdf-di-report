# This is just to test

I am just testing the inclusion of md into a respec file directly, to avoid extra conversions.

I am just writing something about [[[vc-data-integrity]]]Â [[vc-data-integrity]], to see if that is fine. I also

- write
- some
- lists

and also add a note with explicit HTML:

<p class=note>Writing this as a note, just to see.</p>

## This is just a subtopic

To see if that works, too.
